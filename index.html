  <p>Sustainability encompasses much more than replacing an existing funding stream. Broadly speaking, sustainability refers to the capacity (e.g., resources and infrastructure) to maintain a program or service at a desired level to achieve specific outcomes or results.</p>
  <p>Taking a comprehensive view of sustainability includes looking at financial needs and opportunities; considering options for delivery modifications or new partnerships; and policy, systems, and environmental change strategies. </p>
  <p>Developing a sustainability plan can help solidify your organization or programâ€™s goals and get buy-in from critical stakeholders and decision makers. A sustainability plan helps define short and long-term goals related to fund development, policy change strategies, and partnership building.</p>
