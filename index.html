<section id="about">
  <p>This online toolkit includes resources from the Strategies for Sustainability workshop offered to CCPD/HDGP grantees in April 2018, and additional tools and templates to support sustainability planning. Sustainability encompasses much more than replacing an existing funding stream. Broadly speaking, sustainability refers
    to the capacity (e.g., resources and infrastructure) to maintain a program or service at a desired level to achieve specific
    outcomes or results.</p>
  <p>Taking a comprehensive view of sustainability includes looking at financial needs and opportunities; considering options
    for delivery modifications or new partnerships; and policy, systems, and environmental change strategies. </p>
  <p>Developing a sustainability plan can help solidify your organization or program&rsquo;s goals and get buy-in from critical
    stakeholders and decision makers. A sustainability plan helps define short and long-term goals related to fund development,
    policy change strategies, and partnership building.</p>

        <p style="padding-right:12px;">Bringing the Future Into Focus: A Step by Step Sustainability Planning Workbook is a comprehensive step-wise approach
          to planning for sustainability, starting at program inception. The workbook includes an easy-to-read guide, coupled
          with clear &ldquo;your turn&rdquo; activities to work through to create a comprehensive plan for your program or
          initiative. The workbook helps programs look at their sustained impact as well as direct program outcomes - i.e.,
          the impact on partners, a system, or a community that may or may not be dependent on the continuation of the program
          or initiative. It also includes case studies of clinics and community-based organizations. This resource was developed
